Mephitidae is an experiment whose aim is to implement a
semi-functional web browser that looks a lot like firefox, but where
the interface and basic interactions are implemented in web
technologies rather than XUL.  The experiment is hoped to deepen our
understanding of the challenges and benefits moving more of Firefox's
implementation into web technologies.

## The Name

Mephitidae (or Skunk) is a distant relative of the Red panda (aka
firefox), belonging (possibly) to the same superfamily (Musteloidea).
While skunks and red pandas are approximately the same size and
weight, they differ in several very important ways.

## Running it
